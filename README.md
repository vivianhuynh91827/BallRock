# BallRock

5/6/19
Kayla - Display: Created a simple shape and added color.
Vivian - Move - Made the shape move randomly

5/7/19
Kayla - I imported two different images and set their sizes. The balls would choose a random color, movement, and currently, image as well (This would change when we add the simple/complex).  The ball stays in bounds but can only move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
