# BallRock

Rock
- Display: Ruoshui Mao
- Move: Tiffany Cao

5/6/19:
- Tiffany played around with the movements, testing different increments and directions of movements.
- Ruoshui worked on displaying the rock object in the shape of a rectangle, adjusting the sizes and locations.

5/7/19:
- Ruoshui and Tiffany worked on importing images into the code, adjusting the size of the image. Two rock images were chosen and the rock constructor can randomly pick between the two images.
- Tiffany worked on the move method and adjusted the constructor so that the rock objects choose a random movement pattern. The move method was changed to accommodate the choosing of different moving patterns.
We used some references from this website: https://processing.org/discourse/beta/num_1264000877.html to write the movement pattern for a circle.

5/8/19:
- Tiffany added some features to the move method in regards to the wrapping of the screen and what happens when the object moves out of the screen. She also fixed the circle path code that makes the objects orbit in a circle around the center.
- Tiffany and Ruoshui played around with the increment speeds, using the x and y values.

5/10/19:
- Ruoshui added eyes to the living rock and adjusted move method.
- Tiffany experimented with x / y increment speeds.
