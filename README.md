# BallRock

Rock
- Display: Ruoshui Mao
- Move: Tiffany Cao
Ball
- Display: Kayla
- Move: Vivian

5/6/19:
- Tiffany played around with the movements, testing different increments and directions of movements.
- Ruoshui worked on displaying the rock object in the shape of a rectangle, adjusting the sizes and locations.

Kayla - Display: Created a simple shape and added color.
Vivian - Move - Made the shape move randomly

5/7/19:
- Ruoshui and Tiffany worked on importing images into the code, adjusting the size of the image. Two rock images were chosen and the rock constructor can randomly pick between the two images.
- Tiffany worked on the move method and adjusted the constructor so that the rock objects choose a random movement pattern. The move method was changed to accommodate the choosing of different moving patterns.
We used some references from this website: https://processing.org/discourse/beta/num_1264000877.html to write the movement pattern for a circle.

Kayla - I imported two different images and set their sizes. The balls would choose a random color, movement, and currently, image as well (This would change when we add the simple/complex).  The ball stays in bounds but can only move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

5/8/19:
- Tiffany added some features to the move method in regards to the wrapping of the screen and what happens when the object moves out of the screen. She also fixed the circle path code that makes the objects orbit in a circle around the center.
- Tiffany and Ruoshui played around with the increment speeds, using the x and y values.

Kayla - I tried to create random modes (randomly choose between simple/complex/image).  I also tried to code choosing random images as well.  It is still in progress.

5/11/19:
Kayla - I created two subclasses: RealBall and FakeBall.  The simple shapes for each are labeled "F" and "R" to make them easier to differentiate.
